                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            The Bay Area has a largely disconnected transit system with 27 different agencies providing transit. They can experience very slow times and are difficult to navigate while also carrying a negative stigma around them. This causing only 5% of trips to be on these transits while 70% of trips are in personal cars. Heavy reliance on cars have caused traffic issues in the Bay Area and increased greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. The goal is to destigmatize public transportation and unify and strengthen the transportation system in the Bay Area to decrease our reliance on cars and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">To tackle this issue we will break it down into 3 main components; The disconnected transportation system, the large reliance on cars, and the culture. You may not notice it but everytime you make a commute in the Bay Area there have been a set of walls nudging you to transport a certain way, this is especially noticeable when trying to transport around the Bay Area without a car.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">It is known that if you live in the Bay Area that you “basically need a car”. This is embarrassing as many other cities around the world have been able to implement succesful transportation systems in  their heavely populated metropolitan areas. We have 27 agencies that each control some aspect of the transportation system. Many being bus systems that only operate within certain counties. Then there are the large Rail Rapid transit operators which are Bart, Caltrain, and Muni. These systems have shown the potential to be a strength in the transportation within the Bay Area but have failed to unify and be a reliable system to depend on when trying to commute across different areas.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">The lack of a reliable public transportation system has forced many people to heavily rely on cars. This heavy reliance on cars has led to significant traffic congestion, particularly on highways and major roads. Additionally, the Bay Area's dependence on cars has contributed to air pollution and other environmental concerns. According to the EPA (the United States Environmental Protection Agency), the average car vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbondioxide per year. With a population of about 7.76 million people, the Bay Area's heavy reliance on personal vehicles adds to the contribution of carbon dioxide and other pollutants.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">The stigma following public transportation has been heavily impacting the ability to work towards a solution. Many people view public transportation as unreliable, unsafe, or uncomfortable, and therefore choose to drive their own cars instead or even use services like UBER and Lyft. Additionally, the stigma surrounding public transportation has made it difficult for transportation agencies to improve and expand their services, as they may struggle to attract riders. Elon Musk, as an example of this, has been speculated to have proposed his project, hyperloop, to delay California lawmakers from making a high-speed rail. He was vocal about his dislike for public transportation and this is effective for many of the silicon valley families living in the Bay Area. Though it is shown that families of lower income, especially in Oakland, use public transportation much more so this assumption does not apply to everyone. As a result, the Bay Area's reliance on cars has continued to grow, exacerbating traffic problems and other challenges.</p>

                            Looking at all these issues, we can successfully look at each aspect and think about what we do and how we can push for a better Bay Area. First, we need to unify the public transportation systems and make it stronger, you can contribute to this by pushing for your government officials to work towards making this happen. Second, we must destigmatize public transportation and realize how reliant we are on cars. Reflect on yourself and how many miles you may have driven this past year using a private vehicle. If we can all begin using an up-to-date and well-maintained public transportation system it will successfully have been de-stigmatized.
